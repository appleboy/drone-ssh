    settings:
      host:
        - example1.com
        - example2.com
      username: ubuntu
      password:
        from_secret: ssh_password
      port: 22
-     command_timeout: 120
+     command_timeout: 2m
      script:
        - echo "Hello World"
```

## Build or Download a binary

The pre-compiled binaries can be downloaded from [release page](https://github.com/appleboy/drone-ssh/releases). Support the following OS type.

* Windows amd64/386
* Linux arm/amd64/386
* Darwin amd64/386

With `Go` installed

```sh
go get -u -v github.com/appleboy/drone-ssh
```

or build the binary with the following command:

```sh
export GOOS=linux
export GOARCH=amd64
export CGO_ENABLED=0
export GO111MODULE=on

go test -cover ./...

go build -v -a -tags netgo -o release/linux/amd64/drone-ssh .
```

## Docker

Build the docker image with the following commands:

```sh
make docker
```

## Usage

Execute from the working directory:

```sh
docker run --rm \
  -e PLUGIN_HOST=foo.com \
  -e PLUGIN_USERNAME=root \
  -e PLUGIN_KEY="$(cat ${HOME}/.ssh/id_rsa)" \
  -e PLUGIN_SCRIPT=whoami \
  -v $(pwd):$(pwd) \
  -w $(pwd) \
  appleboy/drone-ssh
```

## Mount key from file path

Please make sure that enable the `trusted` mode in project setting for [drone 0.8 version](https://0-8-0.docs.drone.io/).

![trusted mode](./images/trust.png)

Mount private key in `volumes` setting of `.drone.yml` config

```diff
pipeline:
  ssh:
    image: appleboy/drone-ssh
    host: xxxxx.com
    username: deploy
+   volumes:
+     - /root/drone_rsa:/root/ssh/drone_rsa
    key_path: /root/ssh/drone_rsa
    script:
      - echo "test ssh"
```

See the detail of [issue comment](https://github.com/appleboy/drone-ssh/issues/51#issuecomment-336732928).

## Configuration

See [DOCS.md](./DOCS.md) for examples and full configuration options

Configuration options are loaded from multiple sources:

0. Hardcoded drone-ssh defaults.  See [main.go CLI Flags](https://github.com/appleboy/drone-ssh/blob/6d9d6acc6aef1f9166118c6ba8bd214d3a582bdb/main.go#L39) for more information.
1. From a dotenv file at a path specified by the `PLUGIN_ENV_FILE` environment variable.
2. From your `.drone.yml` Drone configuration.

Later sources override previous sources, i.e. if `PORT` is set in an `.env` file committed in the repository or created by previous test steps, it will override the default set `main.go`.
