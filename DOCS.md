Use the SSH plugin to execute commands on a remote server. The below pipeline configuration demonstrates simple usage:

```yaml
- name: ssh commands
  image: appleboy/drone-ssh
  settings:
    host: foo.com
    username: root
    password: 1234
    port: 22
    script:
      - echo hello
      - echo world
```

Example configuration in your `.drone.yml` file for multiple hosts:

```diff
  - name: ssh commands
    image: appleboy/drone-ssh
    settings:
      host:
+       - foo.com
+       - bar.com
      username: root
      password: 1234
      port: 22
      script:
      - echo hello
      - echo world
```

Example configuration for multiple hosts with different port:

```diff
  - name: ssh commands
    image: appleboy/drone-ssh
    settings:
      host:
+       - foo.com:1234
+       - bar.com:5678
      username: root
      password: 1234
-     port: 22
      script:
      - echo hello
      - echo world
```

Example configuration for command timeout, default value is 60 seconds:

```diff
  - name: ssh commands
    image: appleboy/drone-ssh
    settings:
      host: foo.com
      username: root
      password: 1234
      port: 22
+       command_timeout: 2m
      script:
        - echo hello
        - echo world
```

Example configuration for execute commands on a remote server using ｀SSHProxyCommand｀:

```diff
  - name: ssh commands
    image: appleboy/drone-ssh
    settings:
      host: foo.com
      username: root
      password: 1234
      port: 22
      script:
        - echo hello
        - echo world
+     proxy_host: 10.130.33.145
+     proxy_user: ubuntu
+     proxy_port: 22
+     proxy_password: 1234
```

Example configuration using password from secrets:

```diff
  - name: ssh commands
    image: appleboy/drone-ssh
    settings:
      host: foo.com
      username: root
+     password:
+       from_secret: ssh_password
      port: 22
      script:
        - echo hello
        - echo world
```

Example configuration using ssh key from secrets:

```diff
  - name: ssh commands
    image: appleboy/drone-ssh
    settings:
      host: foo.com
      username: root
      port: 22
+     key:
+       from_secret: ssh_key
      script:
        - echo hello
        - echo world
```

Example configuration for exporting custom secrets:

```diff
  - name: ssh commands
    image: appleboy/drone-ssh
    environment:
      commit: ${DRONE_BUILD_NUMBER}
    settings:
      host: foo.com
      username: root
      password: 1234
      port: 22
+     envs:
        - aws_access_key_id
        - commit
      script:
        - export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
        - echo $commit
```

Example configuration for stoping script after first failure:

```diff
  - name: ssh commands
    image: appleboy/drone-ssh
    settings:
      host: foo.com
      username: root
      password: 1234
      port: 22
+     script_stop: true
      script:
        - mkdir abc/def/efg
        - echo "you can't see the steps."
```

Example configuration for passphrase which protecting a private key:

```diff
  - name: ssh commands
    image: appleboy/drone-ssh
    settings:
      host: foo.com
      username: root
+     key:
+       from_secret: ssh_key
+     passphrase: 1234
      port: 22
      script:
        - mkdir abc/def/efg
        - echo "you can't see the steps."
```
