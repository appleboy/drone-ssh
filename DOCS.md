Use the SSH plugin to execute commands on a remote server. The below pipeline configuration demonstrates simple usage:

```yaml
pipeline:
  ssh:
    image: appleboy/drone-ssh
    host: foo.com
    username: root
    password: 1234
    port: 22
    script:
      - echo hello
      - echo world
```

Example configuration in your `.drone.yml` file for multiple hosts:

```diff
pipeline:
  ssh:
    image: appleboy/drone-ssh
    host:
+    - foo.com
+    - bar.com
    username: root
    password: 1234
    port: 22
    script:
      - echo hello
      - echo world
```

Example configuration for login with user private key:

```diff
pipeline:
  ssh:
    image: appleboy/drone-ssh
    host: foo.com
    username: root
-   password: 1234
+   key: ${DEPLOY_KEY}
    port: 22
    script:
      - echo hello
      - echo world
```

Example configuration for login with file path of user private key:

```diff
pipeline:
  ssh:
    image: appleboy/drone-ssh
    host: foo.com
    username: root
-   password: 1234
+   key_path: ./deploy/key.pem
    port: 22
    script:
      - echo hello
      - echo world
```

Example configuration for command timeout (unit: second), default value is 60 seconds:

```diff
pipeline:
  ssh:
    image: appleboy/drone-ssh
    host: foo.com
    username: root
    password: 1234
    port: 22
+   command_timeout: 10
    script:
      - echo hello
      - echo world
```

Example configuration for success build:

```diff
pipeline:
  ssh:
    image: appleboy/drone-ssh
    host: foo.com
    username: root
    password: 1234
    port: 22
    script:
      - echo hello
      - echo world
+   when:
+     status: success
```

Example configuration for tag event:

```diff
pipeline:
  ssh:
    image: appleboy/drone-ssh
    host: foo.com
    username: root
    password: 1234
    port: 22
    script:
      - echo hello
      - echo world
+   when:
+     status: success
+     event: tag
```
